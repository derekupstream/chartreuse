# Overview

This calculator enables food suppliers and their accounts to determine the cost and savings of replacing single-use supplies with recyclable alternatives.

## Models
All data schemas are defined in prisma/schema.prisma.

### Organization
An organization is the highest level of user membership. At the moment, user must be part of an organization, and the system only supports one organization.
Note: the Upstream admin is accessible to organizations with `isUpstream` column set to true.

### Account
A collection of projects. Admins can assign each user in their organization to a specific account.

### Project
A kitchen, hotel, or other location that has its own inventory and calculator results.

### Product
Single-use products are currently committed as code in CSV format. They include materials and other data that enable the calculator to make projections on environmental impact.

### User
Users and their sessions are managed by Firebase. There are no permissions, per se, other than that all users only have access to a single organization. They can also be assigned to a specific account.
